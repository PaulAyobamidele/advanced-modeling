## Linear Regression Model in Action

To illustrate the linear regression model in action, we generated 50 random values using the `rnorm` function.

We also created our basic model of:

\[
y = mx + c
\]

where:

- **y** is the response variable
- **m** is the slope, the magnitude effect on the response variable as x changes
- **c** is the baseline, or the intercept.

### Introducing Error into the Equation

We introduced error into the equation as follows:

\[
y = mx + c + \text{errors}
\]

### Fitting a Linear Model

We generated a model by regressing `y` on `x`. Then, we predicted the values for the response variable using new `x` variables.

### Using the `predict()` Function

The `predict()` function is used to make predictions. It takes two inputs:

1. The model, which forms the basis of predictions.
2. The set of new values for which predictions are to be generated.

#### Conditions for `predict()` to Work

1. The array of new values to be predicted must be in the form of a dataframe or a tibble.
2. The new tibble from above must be named exactly the same as the predictor variable in the model.

## Using Tidyverse Functions for Linear Models

### Steps:

1. Put the data into a tibble and refit the model.
2. Import the `broom` package.
3. Use the following functions:
   - `tidy()`: Provides a clean summary of the model.
   - `glance()`: Displays model-level metrics.
   - `augment()`: Adds predictions and residuals to the dataset.

## Plotting the Model with ggplot2

We can plot the model using `ggplot2` by utilizing the `geom_smooth()` function.

## Understanding Model Notation: `y ~ x` and `y ~ 1 + x`

The formula `y ~ x` is equivalent to `y ~ 1 + x`. This represents the model:

\[
y = mx + c
\]

Here, `y` is estimated not only by the slope (**m**, the magnitude of effect) but also the intercept (**c**), which assumes the value `1`.

### Constructing an Intercept-Only Model

To construct an intercept-only model, we use:

\[
y ~ 1
\]

This creates a "null model," which only includes one coefficient: the intercept.

### Interpreting the Intercept

The intercept represents the average value of the response variable when the slope is zero. Mathematically, this value is equal to the simple mean of `y`:

\[
\text{mean}(y) = \text{coef(null_mdl)}
\]
